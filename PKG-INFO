        ## What is this?
        Django Themes provides a mechanism for theming media for your web applications. This is done by storing a Theme model that contains a name for your theme and it's related directory. You can then access the list of themes and the current theme through these custom context_processors:
        
        ### themes.context_processors.list
        
        Gets the complete theme list and sets it to a context variable, theme_list
        
        ### themes.context_processors.current
        
        Gets the current theme and sets it to a context variable, current_theme
        
        ## Future developments:
        - Tie this system into the template system, so that themes can override other
          templates if needed.
        - Provide template tags that are functionally equivalent to the currently
          provided context processors.
